# Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. Dashboard
The dashboard for Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. provides a comprehensive and visually compelling overview of the company's key performance indicators, customer distribution, policy activity, and claim behavior. The data used in this report was initially extracted from a CSV file, imported into Microsoft SQL Server for structured storage and management, and finally transformed and visualized using Microsoft Power BI. This multi-step pipeline ensured clean, accurate, and interactive data presentation for stakeholders.

The company has achieved a total premium collection of ₹5.98 million, with a coverage value of ₹600.55 million, and claims amounting to ₹16.91 million. Gender distribution among customers is nearly equal, with 5,003 male and 5,001 female policyholders, highlighting balanced market penetration.

Among the various policy types, Travel insurance leads the premium contributions with ₹2.5 million, followed by Health (₹1.2M), Auto (₹1.0M), Life (₹0.7M), and Home (₹0.6M). This suggests a strong demand for travel-related coverage and potentially increased travel activity among customers.

When analyzing claims by age group, adults account for the highest claim amount at ₹8.8 million, followed by elders at ₹6.4 million and young adults at ₹1.7 million. This indicates that the adult demographic is the most active in terms of claims, which could guide future product tailoring and risk assessments.

The company currently holds a policy activity rate of 58.13%, with 5,820 active policies out of a total, while 4,190 policies remain inactive (41.87%). This is a positive sign, but also signals potential for re-engagement strategies with inactive customers.

In terms of claim statuses, rejected claims dominate with 4,400 instances, compared to 3,400 settled and 2,300 pending. This high rejection rate calls for a deeper dive into claim approval processes and customer communication strategies to improve satisfaction and policyholder retention.

Further breakdown by policy type reveals that Travel and Health policies not only generate the most premium but also account for the highest number of rejected and settled claims. Travel insurance alone shows over ₹10.7 million in rejected claims, with ₹6.8 million settled, highlighting a critical area for review to ensure fairness and customer trust.

In conclusion, this dashboard offers actionable insights into Prism Insurance’s business operations and customer behavior. The clear visualization of data transformed from CSV to SQL Server and finally modeled in Power BI reflects a strong data-driven approach to decision-making. The company is performing well in several key areas, but addressing the high rate of claim rejections and re-engaging inactive policyholders can further enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
