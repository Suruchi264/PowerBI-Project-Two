# Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. Dashboard
The Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. dashboard provides a detailed analytical view of the company’s insurance portfolio, focusing on policy distribution, premium generation, customer demographics, and claim performance. This visual representation highlights key financial indicators such as a total premium amount of ₹5.98 million, a total coverage amount of ₹600.55 million, and claims amounting to ₹16.91 million.

In terms of customer demographics, the company serves a nearly equal distribution of male and female policyholders, with 5,003 males and 5,001 females. This suggests a balanced outreach and inclusive approach across genders. When analyzing premium contributions by policy type, travel insurance leads significantly by generating ₹2.5 million in premium revenue, followed by health insurance with ₹1.2 million and auto insurance at ₹1.0 million. Life and home insurance follow behind with relatively lower contributions. This indicates that travel policies are the most popular or most profitable, playing a key role in the company’s revenue stream.

Looking at the age-based claim distribution, adult customers account for the highest claim amount at ₹8.8 million, while elders follow with ₹6.4 million and young adults with ₹1.7 million. This trend suggests that adults not only make up a significant customer base but also experience the highest number of claim events, which could guide future underwriting strategies.

The policy activity data shows that 58.13% of policies are active, while 41.87% are inactive. While the majority of customers maintain active policies, the inactive proportion suggests room for re-engagement or policy renewal campaigns. When evaluating claim status, rejections account for the largest share with 4,400 claims, followed by 3,400 settled claims and 2,300 pending claims. The relatively high number of rejections may signal areas needing review, such as claim verification processes or customer clarity on policy terms.

Lastly, a deeper look at claims by policy type shows that health and travel insurance policies lead in both the value of claims settled and rejected. Health insurance alone has settled claims worth ₹4.00 million but also sees rejections exceeding ₹5.24 million. Travel insurance, in particular, has the highest number of rejections at over ₹10.7 million, paired with a high volume of claims pending and settled. This trend underlines the importance of evaluating the risk profiles and claim processes associated with high-traffic policy types.

In conclusion, this dashboard paints a clear picture of Prism Insurance’s operational strengths and focus areas. While the company shows balanced customer demographics and strong premium performance in specific sectors like travel and health, the high rate of claim rejections and inactive policies suggests potential improvements in customer experience, claim transparency, and policy lifecycle engagement.
